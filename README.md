# ActionSheetDemo

The Action Sheet Demo is a simple iOS application that demonstrates the use of action sheets to present multiple action options in an intuitive way. It provides users with a straightforward interface to trigger and handle different actions.

## Features
- **Action Buttons**: Includes "OK," "Cancel," "Submit," and "Delete" options for various tasks.
- **Custom Actions**: Executes specific logic or prints messages based on the selected action.
- **Action Sheet Style**: Displays options in a clear and organized manner using `UIAlertController`.
- A clean and user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## How It Works
- When the user taps the action sheet button, a `UIAlertController` in action sheet style appears, displaying the available options.
- Clicking any button closes the action sheet and triggers the respective action, such as printing the selected button title or performing a defined task.
